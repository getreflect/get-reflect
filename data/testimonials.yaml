  feedback: Despite there being a lot of similar extensions, reflect's detailing puts it on top of all of the other extensions I've used. reflect simplifies productivity and mindfulness in a world where accessibility is prioritized in clutter and distraction.

  feedback: I love this extension! In my experiences with other extensions it has not been enough to simply block or "pause" websites that you are trying to refrain from to increase productivity. Having to justify the reason why you are visiting a site is enough to help me snap back to doing productive work.
